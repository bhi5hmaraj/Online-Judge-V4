1. Apollonius theorem for length of Median
2. A number N can be written as sum of 2 squares if N is divisible by a prime of the form 4k+1 
3. Use euler totient in sum of GCD
4. Benchmarks (Registration,Queries about less than equal) /****DONT USE Arrays.sort on primitives use on wrapper classes instead or shuffle the array
5. Scanner on a string with delimiters wont return empty string if either first or last char is a delimiter 
6. can specify multiple delimiters using | eg. ";|,"
7. For comparing 2 doubles  compare their Double.doubleToLongBits(double d) functions /*******
8.Overloading propogates up the inheritance chain and overriding propogates down from the declared class of the object which calls the method. It binds to the  nearest method which is overloaded irrespective of the actual Type of the argument(if the argument is a reference data type).Or else it gets binded to the method defined in the actual type of the calling object.     A obj = new B(); here A is declared type and B is actual type and B extends A
9. In Uva judge if the number of lines of input is not specified then use scanner and check hasNext in while loop and then parse the input.
10. There are no easy and hard problems , there are only problems which I can do and I can't 
11. Always be skeptical about greedy , if you can't prove it's optimality . 
12. When you encounter a DP state where the number of parameters is high , try to make one of the parameters into the returned value of the DP state , for more details look at http://codeforces.com/contest/837/problem/D
13. Be careful with linear inequalities , when you have a inequality like ax + b > c , then the inequality x > (c - b) / a need not be true
    for example when a = -1 , b = 3 , c = 5 the correct inequality is x < 2 but x > (5 - 3) / -1 is wrong.
14. Java divison for negative numbers act weird , -5/2 yields -2 but if the convention of rounding down is followed it should have been -3
15. Similarity between problem solving and a sword duel . The final death blow would be coding the soution (You can also fuck up this one eg. GOT red viper and Mountain) . But the rest would depend on your Math , problem solving skills . As we see time doesnt really matter . Also each and every time you win a battle you learn something new also you need to fix your mistakes or else they will haunt you .

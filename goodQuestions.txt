My Ideas:
	Farthest distance between any 2 nodes in a tree (diameter) (with negative weights) ( O(N) expected (not yet proved) ) Idea : Start from a leaf node with prefixSum 0 and dfs the tree , now answer is max(prefixSum) - min(prefixSum)
	|
	|---> Can't be done without LCA !!
	|---> Start from any arbitary vertex and find the distance to all other nodes . Now start from the farthest node and repeat it again.
	      We will get the 2 end points of the diameter.

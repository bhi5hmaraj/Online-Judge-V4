# Online-Judge-V4
This is the 4th version of the eclipse project which contains most of my programming contest work. 

Most of the commits are from a cron job which runs every hours to check for changes and commits it with a time stamp.

For easy searching and usability in Eclipse, I have put all my helper code into a single file which is available at [helper.java](https://github.com/bhi5hmaraj/Online-Judge-V4/blob/master/src/helper.java)
